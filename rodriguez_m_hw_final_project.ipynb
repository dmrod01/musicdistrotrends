    "Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last 25 years, the music industry has changed due to the internet and cell devices. Back in the day, music artists were 'discovered' and signed by a label, had music recorded in a large studio. Music catalogs were maintained by the distribution network. Records and CD's were distributed to music stores. Major music stores such as Tower Records, FYE have closed. The revenue from this channel is decreasing as the traditional recorded music marketing and distribution has shifted to digital. \n",
    "\n",
    "Napster, a peer-to-peer music sharing network in the late 1990's began the revolution of downloading and sharing music for free. Record labels and groups such as Metallica fought this, banning anyone from Napster who downloaded their music (only effective on cable modems with static IP addresses).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Social media has become very important. About 2004, MySpace was one of the first websites where an artist could create their own site and market their music internationally. It's popularity gave way to Facebook because it lost it's original focus. \n",
    "\n",
    "Digital publishing and distribution has become an important channel for music revenue. Subscription services such as Spotify and ITunes are 'stores' for customers to download music for free or purchase.  Artists get paid depending on the number of downloads, but the threshold of required downloads is very high and the pay is pennies on the dollar. Also important is the ability to keep track of revenues from the different stores, so it is important to select the correct digital music distribution site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bands and artists have the ability to recorded via a PC using programs such as Adobe Premier or Pro Tools and do not need to go to a major studio. They can upload their recorded media directly to the digital site.\n",
    "\n",
    "CD's are also sold directly by the artist at shows. Records had virtually disappeared for awhile and have now resurged as 'Vinyls' and CD's are going away. \n",
    "Bottom line: The ability to make money has changed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Business questions:\n",
    "Based on the current environment, we will be performing analytics to determine the following: \n",
    "- Where do we focus effort in the digital music market?\n",
    "- What should the recording studio be focusing on?\n",
    "- What are the trends for marketing music online and at live performances? \n"

    "The digital distribution music companies are a large source of music distribution which depends on social media for promotion. Entities such as Soundcloud are mentioned a great deal and appears many artists are associated with them, may be a reason to look at their services. CD Baby is more popular than TuneCore based on Fan metrics. Entities such as Reverbnation are networked with news media, promoters and associations with the grammy's and could be a source of exposure for those external groups, however, the largest network appears to be within it's own organization which could be limiting to a musician or artist. With YouTube and that many like to watch videos as much as listen to music, video production is as important as audio.  Recording studios still are relevant. Genres such as Rap and Hip Hop are mentioned a lot and may be a focus for recruiting business. That genre uses 'beats' which can be recorded and marketed. The same can be said about Indie music. Bandcamp is mentioned a lot in the facebook statuses but no tweets.  \n",

    "The recommedation is to utilize the distributor that fits your needs for exposure. Keep an open mind to diverse selection of genres and that hip hop and Indie type music has a greater appeal."
